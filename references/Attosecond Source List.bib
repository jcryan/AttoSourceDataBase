	abstract = {We report on the first streaking measurement of water-window attosecond pulses generated via high-harmonic generation, driven by sub-2-cycle, carrier-to-envelope-phase-stable, 1850-nm laser pulses. Both the central photon energy and the energy bandwidth far exceed what has been demonstrated thus far, warranting the investigation of the attosecond streaking technique for the soft-x-ray regime and the limits of the frogcrab retrieval algorithm under such conditions. We also discuss the problem of attochirp compensation and issues regarding much lower photoionization cross sections compared with the extreme ultraviolet in addition to the fact that several shells of target gases are accessed simultaneously. Based on our investigation, we caution that the vastly different conditions in the soft-x-ray regime warrant a diligent examination of the fidelity of the measurement and the retrieval procedure.},

We report on the confinement of the nonlinear interaction of light with matter to a single wave cycle and demonstrate its utility for time-resolved and strong-field science. The electric field of 3.3-femtosecond, 0.72-micron laser pulses with a controlled and measured waveform ionizes atoms near the crests of the central wave cycle, with ionization being virtually switched off outside this interval. Isolated sub-100-attosecond pulses of extreme ultraviolet light (photon energy ∼ 80 electron volts), containing ∼0.5 nanojoule of energy, emerge from the interaction with a conversion efficiency of ∼10–6. These tools enable the study of the precision control of electron motion with light fields and electron-electron interactions with a resolution approaching the atomic unit of time (∼24 attoseconds).
Ionizing neon atoms with light pulses generates shorter light bursts, less than 100 attoseconds long, that can be used to test electron interactions and strong-field theories.

By combining a two-colour field synthesis and an energy-scaling method of high-order harmonic generation, the maximum pulse energy of the isolated attosecond pulse reaches as high as 1.3 μJ. The generated pulse with a duration of 500 as, as characterized by a nonlinear autocorrelation measurement, is the shortest and highest-energy pulse ever with the ability to induce nonlinear phenomena.

With attosecond streaking spectroscopy we observe the breakdown of this single active-electron approximation by recording up to six attoseconds retardation of the dislodged photoelectron due to electronic correlations. We recorded the photon-energy-dependent emission timing of electrons, released from the helium ground state by an extreme-ultraviolet photon, either leaving the ion in its ground state or exciting it into a shake-up state. We identify an optical field-driven d.c. Stark shift of charge-asymmetric ionic states formed after the entangled photoemission as a key contribution to the observed correlation time shift. These findings enable a complete wavepacket reconstruction and are universal for all polarized initial and final states. Sub-attosecond agreement with quantum mechanical ab initio modelling allows us to determine the absolute zero of time in the photoelectric effect to a precision better than 1/25th of the atomic unit of time.},

We show that high-harmonic generation can produce higher photon energies and flux by using higher laser intensities than are typical, strongly ionizing the medium and creating plasma that reshapes the driving laser field. We obtain high harmonics capable of supporting attosecond pulses up to photon energies of 600 {eV} and a photon flux inside the water window (284 to 540 {eV}) 10 times higher than previous attosecond sources. We demonstrate that operating in this regime is key for attosecond pulse generation in the x-ray range and will become increasingly important as harmonic generation moves to even longer-wavelength driving fields.
X-ray harmonics made with long-wavelength lasers reach higher fluxes and photon energies when plasma effects dominate.

	abstract = {Attosecond metrology has so far largely remained limited to titanium:sapphire lasers combined with an active stabilization of the carrier-envelope phase ({CEP}). These sources limit the achievable photon energy to \&\#x0223C;100 {eV} which is too low to access X-ray absorption edges of most second- and third-row elements which are central to chemistry, biology and material science. Therefore, intense efforts are underway to extend attosecond metrology to the soft-X-ray ({SXR}) domain using mid-infrared (mid-{IR}) drivers. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a method that solves the long-standing problem of the complete temporal characterization of ultra-broadband (\&\#x0226B;10 {eV}) attosecond pulses. We generalize the recently proposed Volkov-transform generalized projection algorithm ({VTGPA}) to the case of multiple overlapping photoelectron spectra and demonstrate its application to isolated attosecond pulses. This new approach overcomes all key limitations of previous attosecond-pulse reconstruction methods, in particular the central-momentum approximation ({CMA}), and it incorporates the physical, complex-valued and energy-dependent photoionization matrix elements. These properties make our approach general and particularly suitable for attosecond supercontinua of arbitrary bandwidth. We apply this method to attosecond {SXR} pulses generated from a two-cycle mid-{IR} driver, covering a bandwidth of \&\#x0223C;100 {eV} and reaching photon energies up to 180 {eV}. We extract an {SXR} pulse duration of (43\&\#x000B1;1) as from our streaking measurements, defining a new world record. Our results prove that the popular and broadly available scheme of post-compressing the output of white-light-seeded optical parametric amplifiers is adequate to produce high-contrast isolated attosecond pulses covering the L-edges of silicon, phosphorous and sulfur. Our new reconstruction method and experimental results open the path to the production and characterization of attosecond pulses lasting less than one atomic unit of time (24 as) and covering X-ray absorption edges of most light elements.},

So far, such extreme ultraviolet pulses have only been generated using high power, few-cycle lasers, which are very difficult to construct and operate. We propose and demonstrate a technique called generalized double optical gating for generating isolated attosecond pulses with 20 fs lasers from a hollow-core fiber and 28 fs lasers directly from an amplifier. These pulses, generated from argon gas, are measured to be 260 and 148 as by reconstructing the streaked photoelectron spectrograms. This scheme, with a relaxed requirement on laser pulse duration, makes attophysics more accessible to many laboratories that are capable of producing such multicycle laser pulses.},

When the laser field drives the wavepackets back to the parent ion, they interfere with the bound wavefunction, producing coherent subfemtosecond extreme-ultraviolet light bursts. When only a single return is possible2,3, an isolated attosecond pulse is generated. Here we demonstrate that by modulating the polarization of a carrier-envelope phase-stabilized short laser pulse4, we can finely control the electron-wavepacket dynamics. We use high-order harmonic generation to probe these dynamics. Under optimized conditions, we observe the signature of a single return of the electron wavepacket over a large range of energies. This temporally confines the extreme-ultraviolet emission to an isolated attosecond pulse with a broad and tunable bandwidth. Our approach is very general, and extends the bandwidth of attosecond isolated pulses in such a way that pulses of a few attoseconds seem achievable. Similar temporal resolution could also be achieved by directly using the broadband electron wavepacket. This opens up a new regime for time-resolved tomography of atomic or molecular wavefunctions5,6 and ultrafast dynamics.},

Recent developments have pushed the duration of laser pulses close to its natural limit—the wave cycle, which lasts somewhat longer than one femtosecond (1 fs = 10-15 s) in the visible spectral range. Time-resolved measurements with these pulses are able to trace dynamics of molecular structure, but fail to capture electronic processes occurring on an attosecond (1 as = 10-18 s) timescale. Here we trace electronic dynamics with a time resolution of ≤ 150 as by using a subfemtosecond soft-X-ray pulse and a few-cycle visible light pulse. Our measurement indicates an attosecond response of the atomic system, a soft-X-ray pulse duration of 650 ± 150 as and an attosecond synchronism of the soft-X-ray pulse with the light field.

Numerical simulations of the generation process show that the carrier-envelope phase of the attosecond pulses is stable. The availability of single-cycle isolated attosecond pulses opens the way to a new regime in ultrafast physics, in which the strong-field electron dynamics in atoms and molecules is driven by the electric field of the attosecond pulses rather than by their intensity profile.

Here, we report the generation of isolated soft X-ray attosecond pulses with an X-ray free-electron laser. Our source has a pulse energy that is millions of times larger than any other source of isolated attosecond pulses in the soft X-ray spectral region, with a peak power exceeding 100 {GW}.

This is achieved by enhanced self-amplified spontaneous emission with a 2 μm laser and a dechirper device. Optical compression was achieved by modulating the energy of an electron beam with the laser and then compressing with a chicane, resulting in high current spikes on the beam which we observe to lase. A dechirper was then used to selectively control the lasing region of the electron beam. Field autocorrelation measurements indicate a train of pulses, and we find that the number of pulses within the train can be controlled (from 1 to 5 pulses) by varying the dechirper position and undulator taper. These results are a step toward attosecond spectroscopy with x-ray {FELs} as well as future {FEL} schemes relying on optical compression of an electron beam.},

Here, we demonstrate two-color {APAPS} using a commercial laser system at 1 {kHz}, straightforward post-compression in a hollow-core fiber, and a compact high-harmonic generation ({HHG}) setup. The latter enables the generation of intense extreme-ultraviolet ({XUV}) pulses by using an out-of-focus {HHG} geometry and by exploiting a transient blueshift of the driving laser in the {HHG} medium. Near-isolated attosecond pulses are generated, as demonstrated by one-color and two-color {XUV}-pump {XUV}-probe experiments.

New developments come through parametric waveform synthesis, which provides control over the shape of field transients, enabling the creation of highly-tunable isolated attosecond pulses via high-harmonic generation. Here we demonstrate that the first goal is fulfilled since central energy, spectral bandwidth/shape and temporal duration of isolated attosecond pulses can be controlled by shaping the laser waveform via two key parameters: the relative-phase between two halves of the multi-octave spanning spectrum, and the overall carrier-envelope phase. These results not only promise to expand the experimental possibilities in attosecond science, but also demonstrate coherent strong-field control of free-electron trajectories using tailored optical waveforms.},

Although with the high-repetition rate lasers, such attosecond pulses in a pump-probe configuration are possible to achieve, until now, only a few such light sources have been demonstrated. Here, by shaping the driving laser to an annular beam, a 100 {kHz} attosecond pulse train ({APT}) is reported with the highest energy so far (51 {pJ}/shot) on target (269 {pJ} at generation) among the high-repetition rate systems ({\textgreater}10 {kHz}) in which the attosecond pulses were temporally characterized. The on-target pulse energy is maximized by reducing the losses from the reflections and filtering of the high harmonics, and an unprecedented 19\% transmission rate from the generation point to the target position is achieved. At the same time, the probe beam is also annular and low loss of this beam is reached by using another holey mirror to combine with the {APT}. The advantages of using an annular beam to generate attosecond pulses with a high-average power laser are demonstrated experimentally and theoretically. The effect of nonlinear propagation in the generation medium on the annular-beam generation concept is also analyzed in detail.},

	abstract = {Ångstrom and attosecond are the fundamental spatiotemporal scales for electron dynamics in various materials. Although attosecond pulses with wavelengths comparable to the atomic scales are expected to be a key tool in advancing attosecond science, producing high-power hard X-ray attosecond pulses at ångstrom wavelengths remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report the generation of terawatt-scale attosecond hard X-ray pulses using a free-electron laser in a special operation mode. We achieved 9 {keV} single-spike X-ray pulses with a mean pulse energy of around 180 μJ, exceeding previous reports by more than an order of magnitude, and an estimated average pulse duration of 200 as at full-width at half-maximum. Exploiting the unique capability of the European {XFEL}, which can deliver ten pulse trains per second with each containing hundreds of pulses at megahertz repetition rates, this study demonstrates the generation of attosecond X-ray pulses at a 2.25 {MHz} repetition rate. These intense high-repetition-rate attosecond X-ray pulses present transformative prospects for structural and electronic damage-free X-ray measurements and attosecond time-resolved X-ray methodologies, heralding a new era in ultrafast X-ray science.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear responses to an optical field are universal in nature but have been difficult to observe in the extreme ultraviolet ({XUV}) and soft X-ray regions owing to a lack of coherent intense light sources. High harmonic generation is a well-known nonlinear optical phenomenon1,2 and is now drawing much attention in attosecond pulse generation3,4,5,6. For the application of high harmonics to nonlinear optics in the {XUV} and soft X-ray regime, optical pulses should have both large pulse energy and short pulse duration to achieve a high optical electric field. Here we show the generation of intense isolated pulses from a single harmonic (photon energy 27.9 {eV}) by using a sub-10-femtosecond blue laser pulse, producing a large dipole moment at the relatively low (ninth) harmonic order nonadiabatically7,8. The {XUV} pulses with pulse durations of 950 attoseconds and 1.3 femtoseconds were characterized by an autocorrelation technique, based on two-photon above-threshold ionization9 of helium atoms. Because of the small cross-section for above-threshold ionization10, such an autocorrelation measurement of {XUV} pulses with photon energy larger than the ionization energy of helium has not hitherto been demonstrated6,11,12,13. The technique can be extended to the characterization of higher harmonics at shorter wavelengths.},

The dependence of the gated spectra on the carrier-envelope phase of the laser provided evidence that isolated attosecond pulses were generated. In addition, to ensure the temporal coherence of the {XUV} light, the pulse shape and phase of isolated 107 as {XUV} pulses using a portion of the spectrum were characterized by attosecond streaking.},

	abstract = {Ultrashort laser pulses can serve as fast probes to record instant events. The isolated attosecond pulses ({IAPs}) generated from high-order harmonic generation ({HHG}) have been shortened down to about 2 atomic units in time, empowering us to study quantum behaviors of electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids with unprecedented time resolution. Following the cutoff energy law of {HHG}, the shortest {IAP} reported so far is driven with short-wavelength infrared ({SWIR}) pulses, which require additional broadband frequency conversion techniques and raise the bar for attosecond researches. Here, we show that with few-cycle near-infrared ({NIR}) laser pulses, {IAP} with pulse duration of 51 ± 4 as is generated during 1-fs linear polarization gate formed by generalized double optical gating ({GDOG}) technique. The characterization is done with attosecond streak camera, and phase reconstruction is performed with quick phase retrieval by omega oscillation filtering ({qPROOF}). Furthermore, we show that the {IAP} generation favors certain carrier envelope phases ({CEPs}) in the narrow gate, i.e., {IAP} is only efficiently produced for certain {CEPs}, which eliminates the requirement of {CEP} stabilization. The demonstrated scheme for {IAP} generation in principle has much higher conversion efficiency than the long-wave driver scheme according to the wavelength scaling law of {HHG}. Our work suggests an alternative way to generate ultrashort {IAPs} by applying {GDOG} on few-cycle free-{CEP} {NIR} driving pulses, and is thereby of great importance to facilitate the development of attosecond science and technology.},
