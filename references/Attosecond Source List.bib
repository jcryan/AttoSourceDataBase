	abstract = {We report on the first streaking measurement of water-window attosecond pulses generated via high-harmonic generation, driven by sub-2-cycle, carrier-to-envelope-phase-stable, 1850-nm laser pulses. Both the central photon energy and the energy bandwidth far exceed what has been demonstrated thus far, warranting the investigation of the attosecond streaking technique for the soft-x-ray regime and the limits of the frogcrab retrieval algorithm under such conditions. We also discuss the problem of attochirp compensation and issues regarding much lower photoionization cross sections compared with the extreme ultraviolet in addition to the fact that several shells of target gases are accessed simultaneously. Based on our investigation, we caution that the vastly different conditions in the soft-x-ray regime warrant a diligent examination of the fidelity of the measurement and the retrieval procedure.},

A few-cycle carrier-envelope phase-stable laser pulse centered at 1800 nm was used to generate a stable soft X-ray supercontinuum, with amplitude gating limiting the generated pulse duration to a single optical half-cycle. We report a quantitative transmission measurement of the sulfur L2,3 edge over the range 160–200 {eV} and the carbon K edge from 280 to 330 {eV}. These spectra show all the features previously reported in the {XANES} spectra of polythiophene, but for the first time they are measured with a source that has an approximately 1 fs pulse duration. This study opens the door to measurements that can fully time-resolve the photoexcited electronic dynamics in these systems.},

However, the maximum photon energy of attosecond pulses via {HHG} remains limited to the extreme ultraviolet region. Long-wavelength light sources with carrier-envelope phase stabilization are promising to extend the photon energy of attosecond pulses into the soft X-ray region. Here we demonstrate carrier-envelope phase-dependent {HHG} in the water window using sub-two-cycle optical pulses at 1,600 nm. Experimental and simulated results indicate the confinement of soft X-ray emission in a single recombination event with a bandwidth of 75 {eV} around the carbon K edge. Control of high harmonics by the waveform of few-cycle infrared pulses is a key milestone to generate soft X-ray attosecond pulses. We measure a dependence of half-cycle bursts on the gas pressure, which indicates subcycle deformation of the waveform of the infrared drive pulses in the {HHG} process.},

We report on the confinement of the nonlinear interaction of light with matter to a single wave cycle and demonstrate its utility for time-resolved and strong-field science. The electric field of 3.3-femtosecond, 0.72-micron laser pulses with a controlled and measured waveform ionizes atoms near the crests of the central wave cycle, with ionization being virtually switched off outside this interval. Isolated sub-100-attosecond pulses of extreme ultraviolet light (photon energy ∼ 80 electron volts), containing ∼0.5 nanojoule of energy, emerge from the interaction with a conversion efficiency of ∼10–6. These tools enable the study of the precision control of electron motion with light fields and electron-electron interactions with a resolution approaching the atomic unit of time (∼24 attoseconds).
Ionizing neon atoms with light pulses generates shorter light bursts, less than 100 attoseconds long, that can be used to test electron interactions and strong-field theories.

By combining a two-colour field synthesis and an energy-scaling method of high-order harmonic generation, the maximum pulse energy of the isolated attosecond pulse reaches as high as 1.3 μJ. The generated pulse with a duration of 500 as, as characterized by a nonlinear autocorrelation measurement, is the shortest and highest-energy pulse ever with the ability to induce nonlinear phenomena.

We obtain high harmonics capable of supporting attosecond pulses up to photon energies of 600 {eV} and a photon flux inside the water window (284 to 540 {eV}) 10 times higher than previous attosecond sources. We demonstrate that operating in this regime is key for attosecond pulse generation in the x-ray range and will become increasingly important as harmonic generation moves to even longer-wavelength driving fields.

Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a method that solves the long-standing problem of the complete temporal characterization of ultra-broadband (\&\#x0226B;10 {eV}) attosecond pulses. We generalize the recently proposed Volkov-transform generalized projection algorithm ({VTGPA}) to the case of multiple overlapping photoelectron spectra and demonstrate its application to isolated attosecond pulses. This new approach overcomes all key limitations of previous attosecond-pulse reconstruction methods, in particular the central-momentum approximation ({CMA}), and it incorporates the physical, complex-valued and energy-dependent photoionization matrix elements. These properties make our approach general and particularly suitable for attosecond supercontinua of arbitrary bandwidth. We apply this method to attosecond {SXR} pulses generated from a two-cycle mid-{IR} driver, covering a bandwidth of \&\#x0223C;100 {eV} and reaching photon energies up to 180 {eV}. We extract an {SXR} pulse duration of (43\&\#x000B1;1) as from our streaking measurements, defining a new world record. Our results prove that the popular and broadly available scheme of post-compressing the output of white-light-seeded optical parametric amplifiers is adequate to produce high-contrast isolated attosecond pulses covering the L-edges of silicon, phosphorous and sulfur. Our new reconstruction method and experimental results open the path to the production and characterization of attosecond pulses lasting less than one atomic unit of time (24 as) and covering X-ray absorption edges of most light elements.},

When the laser field drives the wavepackets back to the parent ion, they interfere with the bound wavefunction, producing coherent subfemtosecond extreme-ultraviolet light bursts. When only a single return is possible2,3, an isolated attosecond pulse is generated. Here we demonstrate that by modulating the polarization of a carrier-envelope phase-stabilized short laser pulse4, we can finely control the electron-wavepacket dynamics. We use high-order harmonic generation to probe these dynamics. Under optimized conditions, we observe the signature of a single return of the electron wavepacket over a large range of energies. This temporally confines the extreme-ultraviolet emission to an isolated attosecond pulse with a broad and tunable bandwidth. Our approach is very general, and extends the bandwidth of attosecond isolated pulses in such a way that pulses of a few attoseconds seem achievable. Similar temporal resolution could also be achieved by directly using the broadband electron wavepacket. This opens up a new regime for time-resolved tomography of atomic or molecular wavefunctions5,6 and ultrafast dynamics.},

Recent developments have pushed the duration of laser pulses close to its natural limit—the wave cycle, which lasts somewhat longer than one femtosecond (1 fs = 10-15 s) in the visible spectral range. Time-resolved measurements with these pulses are able to trace dynamics of molecular structure, but fail to capture electronic processes occurring on an attosecond (1 as = 10-18 s) timescale. Here we trace electronic dynamics with a time resolution of ≤ 150 as by using a subfemtosecond soft-X-ray pulse and a few-cycle visible light pulse. Our measurement indicates an attosecond response of the atomic system, a soft-X-ray pulse duration of 650 ± 150 as and an attosecond synchronism of the soft-X-ray pulse with the light field.

New developments come through parametric waveform synthesis, which provides control over the shape of field transients, enabling the creation of highly-tunable isolated attosecond pulses via high-harmonic generation. Here we demonstrate that the first goal is fulfilled since central energy, spectral bandwidth/shape and temporal duration of isolated attosecond pulses can be controlled by shaping the laser waveform via two key parameters: the relative-phase between two halves of the multi-octave spanning spectrum, and the overall carrier-envelope phase. These results not only promise to expand the experimental possibilities in attosecond science, but also demonstrate coherent strong-field control of free-electron trajectories using tailored optical waveforms.},

The on-target pulse energy is maximized by reducing the losses from the reflections and filtering of the high harmonics, and an unprecedented 19\% transmission rate from the generation point to the target position is achieved. At the same time, the probe beam is also annular and low loss of this beam is reached by using another holey mirror to combine with the {APT}. The advantages of using an annular beam to generate attosecond pulses with a high-average power laser are demonstrated experimentally and theoretically. The effect of nonlinear propagation in the generation medium on the annular-beam generation concept is also analyzed in detail.},

Although attosecond pulses with wavelengths comparable to the atomic scales are expected to be a key tool in advancing attosecond science, producing high-power hard X-ray attosecond pulses at ångstrom wavelengths remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report the generation of terawatt-scale attosecond hard X-ray pulses using a free-electron laser in a special operation mode. We achieved 9 {keV} single-spike X-ray pulses with a mean pulse energy of around 180 μJ, exceeding previous reports by more than an order of magnitude, and an estimated average pulse duration of 200 as at full-width at half-maximum.

High harmonic generation is a well-known nonlinear optical phenomenon1,2 and is now drawing much attention in attosecond pulse generation3,4,5,6. For the application of high harmonics to nonlinear optics in the {XUV} and soft X-ray regime, optical pulses should have both large pulse energy and short pulse duration to achieve a high optical electric field. Here we show the generation of intense isolated pulses from a single harmonic (photon energy 27.9 {eV}) by using a sub-10-femtosecond blue laser pulse, producing a large dipole moment at the relatively low (ninth) harmonic order nonadiabatically7,8. The {XUV} pulses with pulse durations of 950 attoseconds and 1.3 femtoseconds were characterized by an autocorrelation technique, based on two-photon above-threshold ionization9 of helium atoms. Because of the small cross-section for above-threshold ionization10, such an autocorrelation measurement of {XUV} pulses with photon energy larger than the ionization energy of helium has not hitherto been demonstrated6,11,12,13. The technique can be extended to the characterization of higher harmonics at shorter wavelengths.},

	abstract = {Ultrashort laser pulses can serve as fast probes to record instant events. The isolated attosecond pulses ({IAPs}) generated from high-order harmonic generation ({HHG}) have been shortened down to about 2 atomic units in time, empowering us to study quantum behaviors of electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids with unprecedented time resolution. Following the cutoff energy law of {HHG}, the shortest {IAP} reported so far is driven with short-wavelength infrared ({SWIR}) pulses, which require additional broadband frequency conversion techniques and raise the bar for attosecond researches. Here, we show that with few-cycle near-infrared ({NIR}) laser pulses, {IAP} with pulse duration of 51 ± 4 as is generated during 1-fs linear polarization gate formed by generalized double optical gating ({GDOG}) technique. The characterization is done with attosecond streak camera, and phase reconstruction is performed with quick phase retrieval by omega oscillation filtering ({qPROOF}). Furthermore, we show that the {IAP} generation favors certain carrier envelope phases ({CEPs}) in the narrow gate, i.e., {IAP} is only efficiently produced for certain {CEPs}, which eliminates the requirement of {CEP} stabilization. The demonstrated scheme for {IAP} generation in principle has much higher conversion efficiency than the long-wave driver scheme according to the wavelength scaling law of {HHG}. Our work suggests an alternative way to generate ultrashort {IAPs} by applying {GDOG} on few-cycle free-{CEP} {NIR} driving pulses, and is thereby of great importance to facilitate the development of attosecond science and technology.},
